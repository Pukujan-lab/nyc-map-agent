# Architecture: a modular monolith

One repo, one Vite SPA, one Hono API, one Octo database. Features land in parallel, so each
feature is a **module** with a fixed shape, and modules talk only through the **shared core**.
No microservices, no Vercel; the API is host-agnostic (`pnpm start` / Dockerfile).

## Module map

```
src/
  core (shared, importable by every feature)
    lib/store/         MapStateContext, DataViewContext, PanelContext (usePanel, usePanelChip, usePanelSearch)
    lib/map/           style.ts, basemap.ts, walk.ts, city3d.ts, threeLayer (the ONE three.js custom layer)
    lib/api/           socrata.ts, geosearch.ts, shared fetch hooks (TanStack Query)
    lib/flags/         typed feature-flag registry (env + ?flags= URL override, tier basic|advanced)
    lib/datasets/      Socrata dataset registry
    components/ui/     shadcn primitives
  features/<name>/     one module per feature (see "Module convention")
server/
  app.ts               mounts core routes + each server/features/<name>/routes.ts
  features/<name>/     Hono routes for that feature
api/                   legacy Web-standard handlers (being moved under server/features/)
ingest/<name>/         SQL (dbmate migrations stay in db/migrations; feature SQL/marts here)
scripts/               build/ingest/publish CLIs, feed-health.ts
```

Rule: `src/features/A` may import `src/lib/**`, `src/components/ui/**` and itself, **never**
`src/features/B`. Core never imports features except through the registry `src/features/index.ts`.
Enforced by dependency-cruiser in CI (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`).

## Module convention

`src/features/<name>/index.ts` default-exports a `FeatureModule`:

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | stable id, also the flag name |
| `layers` | lazy `() => import("./layers")` that installs MapLibre layers |
| `panel` | panel registration (content pushed via `usePanel().showPanel`) |
| `chips` | chips registered with `usePanelChip` |
| `search` | providers registered with `usePanelSearch` |
| `flags` | `{ tier: "basic" \| "advanced", default }` |

Heavy code is reached only through dynamic `import()` so each feature is its own chunk
(size-limit budgets each one). See `docs/MODULES.md` for the migration guide.

## Rendering rules (approved)

- One MapLibre canvas. **deck.gl stays banned.**
- **three.js is approved for 3D models only, via one shared MapLibre custom layer** in the
  same canvas and depth buffer (`src/lib/map/threeLayer.ts`; today `streetSigns.ts` is its
  first user). No feature imports `three` directly; dependency-cruiser rule `three-only-in-3d-layer`.
- `mapillary-js` in `StreetViewSheet` is the one sanctioned photo viewer.

## Progressive disclosure (simple by default)

- The app is **simple by default**. A persisted `advancedMode` setting (localStorage, default
  off, one switch in the settings drawer) unlocks flags with `tier: "advanced"`.
- Basic tier: search, directions, live transit, places/POI, restrooms, street signs, street level,
  noise layer. Advanced tier: classic Crashes, Noise + crashes, registry data/analytics layers,
  averages, feed health. Advanced items join the existing dropdowns; layout does not change.
- Detail panels show the essentials first (name, headline number, next arrivals). Secondary
  info — service alerts, elevator outages, history/timelines, data caveats — sits in
  collapsible drawers (shadcn `Collapsible`/`Accordion`) inside the one panel. No tooltips.

Octo itself: `OCTO_BASE_URL`, `OCTO_API_KEY`, `OCTO_WORKSPACE_ID` (server and GitHub Actions only).
Dev/ops: `VITE_API_BASE`, `PORT`, `OCTO_ENV_FILE`, `INGEST_MONTHS`, `LIVE_SOCRATA`, `CITY`,
`CITY_TILES_FILE`, `PART_MB`, `AREA_SIMPLIFY`, `SOCRATA_BASE`.

Every upstream a browser does not hit directly should go through our Hono proxy so it can be
cached and health-checked (`pnpm feeds:health`, scheduled workflow `feed-health.yml`).

## CI guardrails

- `pnpm lint:boundaries` (dependency-cruiser): no feature→feature imports; `three` only in the 3D layer.
- `pnpm size` (size-limit): per-chunk budgets; fails on regression.
- `pnpm feeds:health`: pings each upstream via our proxy.

## Target: agent-first (2026-10-23, not built)

The product is now an accessible chat and voice agent over the map (`PROJECT.md`). The module shape above stays; these are the changes the target asks for. Each line says whether it exists.

| area | target | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entry | Map with a chat prompt at the bottom and a Siri-style voice mode. Dashboards behind advanced mode (the basic/advanced tier split already exists). | not built; today a top search bar with an "Ask" button |
| Answers | Every agent answer returns **map actions** the UI renders as buttons (show skipped stops, substitute route, nearest restroom, exits). | not built; the agent today moves or highlights the map |
| Context | The agent or app sets a context (on a train, underground, walking, driving) and the map shows only what matters, landmarks always. | manual switches only (Transit Focus, Lines) |
| Top view | Flat 2D only; no three.js layer, no 3D buildings. | Top still tries to render 3D |
| Trains | A colored box with the route tag, plus a side panel (next stops, times, MTA notices). No 3D train model. | model in the three.js layer |
| Live data | Server polls MTA feeds about every minute (it caches 15 s now). Clients read one batched endpoint every 30 to 60 s. | each browser polls every 15 s and calls one endpoint per subway line |
| 3D performance | Keep MapLibre plus the one three.js layer. Draw 3D near the camera only, simple shapes far away, instancing, baked shadows. No game engine. | partly (PMTiles city tiles, size budgets) |
| Trip simulator | Scheduled time, expected conditions, restart when the user picks an alternative route. | speeds exist; the rest does not |
| Languages | Chat and voice in many languages. | not checked |

### Agent reliability (target, partly built)

| area | target | state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model availability | Primary `cb/deepseek-v4.1-flash` via InferHub, with a fallback chain so an LLM is always available when one or two are down. | chain via `INFERHUB_MODEL_FALLBACKS` and busy-retry (#343) exist in `server/features/agent/model-fallback.ts`; a provider-independent fallback is not confirmed |
| Abuse protection | Per-client rate limits and caps on `/api/agent`. | not found on main |
| Waiting | A clear loading animation, and a spoken status ("checking the trains") for slow model or voice replies. | text skeleton only |
| Instructions | A system prompt that knows the available datasets and their limits, asks follow-up questions, and picks the right map action. | tool guidance in `context/CHAT_TOOLS.md` only |
