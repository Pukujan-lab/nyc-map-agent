# NYC Map Agent: Spooky Civic AI Hackathon writeup

*2026-10-24, for the 3percentclub submission. Numbers in square brackets, like [204], are entries in `docs/RESEARCH_SOURCES.md`. Only sources marked fetched there (a researcher read the page) are cited as evidence here; a † marks one that is a search summary only.*

## The problem, in one scene
A woman in her fifties has just moved to New York. She is not comfortable with apps and does not read English well. She stands in a crowded station with no signal. The notice on the wall reads like a code, no station agent is in sight, and she needs a restroom. When she comes up to the street, her map's blue dot jumps and she does not know which way she faces or which exit she took.

## Who it helps
Adults who are new to the city and not digitally confident, especially immigrants; also visitors and anyone whose trip goes wrong.
- About 3.1 million New Yorkers are foreign-born (roughly 40%), and just under half of them have limited English [82] [83]. Nearly 2 million residents are limited-English [489].
- Smartphone ownership among adults 65 and older is 79% nationally, against 97% under 50 [93]. In New York, 1 in 3 of the 1.7 million residents aged 60 and older lacked home internet in 2021 [113].
- The city requires its most-used documents in ten languages [495], and the MTA says it translates service changes and safety notices [507].

## Four problems, and what the app does about each

### 1. "I can't understand or predict my trip"
- **The problem.** Service-change notices read like codes, and it is hard to know how a trip will go on a given day. In 2010 only 42% of platforms and 22% of street entrances had service advisory signs [5]. In 2017 nearly 85% of riders graded on-train delay announcements a "C" or lower [21]. The MTA itself admitted in 2021 that alert wording varies by channel and that it does not know which terms work best [22]. The alerts feed carries route icons as bracket text, such as "Delays on the [F] [G] trains" [633].
- **Why it matters.** Planned work is a quarter of subway delays (25%), and equipment and infrastructure another 31% [425]. Weather can stop everything: Hurricane Ida suspended all subway lines in 2021 [437], and heavy rain cuts evening ridership by under 8% to about 29% depending on the station [453].
- **What we do.** The agent reads the disruptions and the weather, then simulates the trip on the map, for a trip now or a future one, at 2x to 30x, so you see what you will face at home and calm. Choose another route and the simulation restarts. Evidence that showing real-time information helps: in a Seattle study, riders without it perceived waits longer than actual, and riders with it did not [462] (a 2011 bus study).

### 2. "I'm underground and lost"
- **The problem.** GPS.gov lists indoor and underground use as a cause of error [143]; NIST says GPS "rarely works well indoors" [156]. Phone barometers differ by device and cannot tell floors reliably without help [159] [160] [161], which is why a map cannot separate the platform from the street above. Google's Live View is documented for outdoors, and its indoor version for an airport station in Sydney, not a New York subway station [172] [173]. The MTA's real-time spec does not provide a position for a train or a person inside a station [629].
- **What we do.** The app asks whether you are underground instead of guessing, then helps you pick the exit and recalibrate which way you face.
- **Status.** Not built. A camera and compass scaffold exists (see below). We found no study of compass error after surfacing, so we do not claim one.

### 3. "I can't read the map"
- **The problem.** Standard maps are dense, and landmarks and exact stops are small or missing.
- **What we do.** A plain map that keeps recognizable landmarks visible and marks the exact stop or entrance.
- **Evidence.** Honest note: we did not read in full any source on this group. The design follows the landmark-navigation and cognitive-load literature listed in `docs/RESEARCH_SOURCES.md` (theme 5), but we found no study showing a plain landmark map lowers stress in the New York subway, and some evidence cuts against adding landmarks to mobile maps.

### 4. "I urgently need a restroom"
- **The problem.** New York ranked 93rd of the 100 largest US cities for park restrooms per resident in 2019, and 69% of park restrooms were not ADA accessible [204]. About 1,100 publicly managed toilets serve the city, and only 69 of 472 stations had a public bathroom in 2022 [205]. In an MTA Inspector General audit, 5 of 32 visited subway bathrooms were closed, and the MTA was poor at communicating where they are or whether they are open [230]. A Council inspection reported about 11% of restrooms closed during posted hours† [209].
- **What we do.** The nearest open restroom, drawn on the map with a walking route, in one tap.
- **Data limits.** The city dataset is a snapshot of 1,066 records, updated about twice a year, and does not reflect real-time conditions [646]. Subway restroom counts differ by source (the audit says 125 at 65 stations†), so the app shows each record's source and age.

## Why not just use what exists
- The rebuilt MTA app (launched March 2026) has an accessibility mode, elevator status and service-change lookup, but supports English and Spanish only [553]. We found no source showing it explains notices in plain language or helps with exits.
- City Hall's MyCity chatbot gave wrong legal advice to businesses and was taken down in February 2026 [545]. That is why our agent shows its data source, never invents numbers, and says "I don't know".
- Station help is thin: the MTA lists 31 customer service centers, 29 of them subway stations staffed 24/7, out of about 470 stations [386]; about 2,000 agents became roving in 2023 [377]; and a judge voided the 2026 policy of leaving booths unstaffed [393]. The agent is help that is always there.
- We found no source showing another app that combines these four. That is an absence of results, not proof that none exists.

## How it works
An agent you talk to, by chat or voice, that answers by showing the answer on a plain map. Built with React, TypeScript, MapLibre, NYC Open Data, MTA feeds, OpenStreetMap routing and a Claude-based agent with tool calls.

## Safe and fair
- Memory is kept on the phone by default; the agent receives only short summaries a question needs, never full history or exact coordinates. A "What we remember" screen lets people see, pause or delete each kind of memory.
- Every number comes from a data query, and the app shows each dataset's limits.
- MTA data terms require telling users when the data is more than a minute stale and supply it "as is" [628]. The app shows data age, but we have not verified that it does so for every feed.

## What runs today, and what does not
- **Runs on `main`:** the map with live subway lines, trains and service notices; the ask bar with chat and voice; nearest restroom with a walking route; trip planning with the exit to use, weather and line trouble for the trip time; and a sped-up trip preview at 2x to 30x.
- **Languages:** the agent answers in the language you write or speak in, and its spoken replies and status lines use that language too. Voice input passes the language to speech-to-text. The app's buttons and labels are English only so far, and the "hey" wake phrase listens for English.
- **About the demo video:** it is the real app on a phone-sized screen. The agent's replies in the video are scripted, because the recording machine had no model key; the same replies come from the live agent when a key is set.
- **Not built yet:** help when you come up from underground (which exit, which way you face), landmarks as the always-on guide, and where to board substitute buses.
